Motivated, recent high school graduate, with direct transition into the workforce. Experience from immediate professional growth to a position as Logistics Supervisor. Within one month of employment at Vibra Health Laboratory, responsibilities expanded to oversight and fulfillment of all customer facing product and supply orders. Skills obtained from a high demand/ high throughput laboratory environment functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concurrent work on IT infrastructure and systems allowed for a transition to a role as IT Supervisor. This position not only manages the IT for Vibra Health Lab, but also for OSP Health as the parent company. Most recent accomplishments include the entire networking of new OSP/ OSP Health office building and composing compliance documents for our CAP accreditation. In addition, responsibilities include the implementation, maintenance and updates to non-clinical testing hardware.
I have a facination with RF and anything control related.
